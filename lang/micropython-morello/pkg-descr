Micro Python is a lean and efficient implementation of the Python 3
programming language that includes a small subset of the Python
standard library and is optimised to run on microcontrollers and in
constrained environments. This version adds support for the Arm Morello
prototype architecture (Armv8-A with CHERI extensions).
